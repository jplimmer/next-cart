# 🛍️ NextCart

_This repo is a fork of the [NextCart repository](github.com/nextcart-se/next-cart) - this README documents the original group project with my personal contributions highlighted below._

**NextCart** is a minimalist e-commerce platform built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, using data from [Platzi's GraphQL API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/gql/products/). It features server-side rendering and streaming, real-time search, authentication with Clerk and an admin dashboard with CRUD functionality.

## 📖 About the project

This was a group exercise focused on building a minimalist e-commerce platform to practise modern web development patterns.

**Key learnings:**

- Server-side rendering and routing with Next.js 15 App Router
- Type-safe development with TypeScript and Zod validation
- GraphQL API integration with queries, mutations and error-handling
- Implementing mock data fallback for development with environment variables
- Authentication and route protection using Clerk
- Form management with server actions for CRUD operations and contact forms
- Advanced routing patterns with parallel routes and route interception for modals
- Performance optimization through lazy loading and React Suspense
- Dynamic routing with searchParams for filtering and pagination
- Building accessible, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- Agile methodology with iterative development and continuous feedback & communication.
